# BMI_Project

This Project is dogshit i should improve way more and much faster and i dont concentrate and commit enough to my projects alot more could be done and improved and the method of sharing bmi instead of state management is bullshit This project got out the worst in me again due to the constant need of checking what angela had done in the course which was to be honest like 30% but it was the new 30% which i should've known or at least remembered half of them but fuck we can always improve
